# AmazonPriceTracker
# This program prompts a user for 3 entries:
#       1) An email address
#       2) A URL of a desired product
#       3) A price goal
# The program will then check the product's price every day, providing weekly updates via email of the price
# If the product ever hits the price goal, the user will be alerted
